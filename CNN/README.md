### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Introduction to CNNs
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model primarily used for analyzing visual data. CNNs are particularly effective in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and video analysis due to their ability to automatically detect and learn features from images.


## Key Components of CNNs
1. **Convolutional Layers**:
   - Apply filters to input images to extract features such as edges and textures while preserving spatial relationships between pixels.

2. **Activation Functions**:
   - Typically, the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function is used to introduce non-linearity into the model.

3. **Pooling Layers**:
   - Reduce the dimensionality of feature maps to decrease computational load while retaining essential information. Common types include Max Pooling and Average Pooling.

4. **Fully Connected Layers**:
   - Connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, typically used at the end of the network for classification tasks.

## CNN Architecture
A typical CNN structure consists of:
- Input Layer → Convolutional Layer → Activation Layer → Pooling Layer → Fully Connected Layer → Output Layer

### Example Architecture:

Input -> Conv2D -> ReLU -> MaxPooling -> Conv2D -> ReLU -> Flatten -> Dense -> Softmax
